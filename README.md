# Binary Classification Web App: Mushroom Edibility

This Streamlit web application predicts whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on their features. Users can choose between different classifiers, adjust model hyperparameters, and visualize performance metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve. 

The app loads the mushroom dataset directly from GitHub, so no local files are needed. It provides an interactive and easy-to-use interface to explore the results of machine learning models like Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

This project can be run locally or deployed online using Streamlit Community Cloud, allowing anyone to access and test the app through a web browser. It is intended for educational purposes and for demonstrating binary classification techniques with real-world categorical data.
